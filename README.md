# Data-analysis-of-clothing-store

## Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of a clothing store across different online platforms using Excel. I explored key metrics like revenue by state, order status distribution, customer age and gender breakdown, and platform-wise sales. Although the data was available in Excel (CSV) format, I also used SQL queries to demonstrate how basic data analysis can be performed in a real-world setup where data is stored in databases. This project helped me practice data cleaning, building charts, using formulas, and creating a clean dashboard to tell a clear story from raw data.

## Dataset information

This dataset contains order-level details from a clothing store that sells across various platforms, including Amazon and Myntra. It includes:
- Customer Info: ID, gender, age, age group
- Order Details: Order ID, date, month, status, quantity, amount, currency
- Product Info: SKU, category, size
- Sales Channel: Online platform (e.g., Amazon, Meesho)
- Shipping Info: City, state, postal code, country

## Key questions explored 

1. Which are the top 5 states generating the highest revenue?
2. How are the orders distributed across different order statuses (delivered, returned, cancelled)?
3. What is the order distribution across different age groups and genders?
4. Which platforms contribute the most to overall sales revenue?
5. How are orders distributed across various e-commerce platforms?
6. What is the monthly average order value trend?
7. How do sales and order volumes compare month by month?
8. What is the sales share comparison between male and female customers?

## Key analysis & insights

1. Revenue from Top 5 States
- Maharashtra is the top-performing state with ₹2.99M revenue, followed by Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.
- Tamil Nadu and Telangana contribute lower but still significant amounts, near the ₹1.7M mark.

2. Order Status Distribution
- 92% of orders are successfully delivered.
- 8% of orders are either cancelled, returned, or refunded.

3. Percentage of Orders by Age Group & Gender
- Adults (both Men and Women) contribute to ~63% of total orders.
- Seniors (~19%) and Teenagers (~17%) form the secondary segments.
- Order proportions are fairly similar between genders in each age group.

4. Sales Generated by Platform
- Amazon (₹7.52M) and Myntra (₹4.94M) dominate sales, followed by Flipkart.
- Meesho, Ajio, and Nalli contribute less than ₹ 1.5 M.

5. Percentage of Orders Across Each Platform
- Top Performer: Amazon has the highest share of total orders among all platforms.
- Mid-tier: Flipkart and Myntra also hold significant order volume.
- Low Engagement: Ajio, Meesho, Nalli, and "Others" combined make up a small share.

6. Average Order Value (AOV) Trend
- The average order value fluctuates slightly throughout the year.
- Peaks: August (~₹692) and October are the best months in terms of high AOV.
- Drops: June and September saw lower AOVs (~₹674–676), which might indicate seasonal dips or discount-heavy periods.

7. Sales Distribution by Gender
- Women’s products dominate sales at 64%, compared to 36% for men.
- There’s a clear opportunity to focus more on women-centric products or promotions.

8. Sales vs Orders
- Sales amount and number of orders are relatively consistent across the year, though a gradual decline is seen from July to December.
- Despite fluctuations in AOV, overall revenue remains stable, likely due to consistent volume.

## Recommendations
1. Focus marketing efforts on high-performing states like Maharashtra and Karnataka to maximize ROI.
2. Reduce return rates through better quality control and active customer feedback collection.
3. Run age-segmented campaigns, especially targeting adults, to improve engagement and conversion.
4. Double down on Amazon and Flipkart by optimizing product listings, promotions, and ad spend.
5. Explore potential on platforms like Meesho, Ajio, and Nalli with test campaigns, but monitor ROI closely.
6. Leverage the strong female customer base with targeted marketing and personalized offers.
7. Boost sales in low-performing months (June, September) using product bundles and cross-sell strategies.

## Conclusion
This analysis provided a comprehensive view of the clothing store’s performance across states, customer segments, and sales platforms. Maharashtra and Amazon emerged as top contributors to revenue, while women and adult shoppers drove most of the orders. Seasonal trends showed fluctuations in AOV, pointing to key months for targeted marketing. By optimizing strategies for top-performing platforms and demographics, and addressing underperforming areas, the store can unlock further growth and profitability.

## Business impact 
This analysis helps the clothing store make smarter, data-driven decisions to boost sales and customer satisfaction. By focusing on high-performing states like Maharashtra and platforms like Amazon and Myntra, the store can maximize marketing ROI and streamline logistics. Insights into customer demographics, especially the strong female and adult shopper base, support targeted promotions and product strategies. Identifying seasonal drops in average order value allows for well-timed discounts and bundling offers. Reducing return rates and optimizing performance on underutilized platforms can further increase profitability.
