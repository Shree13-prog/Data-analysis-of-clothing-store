# Data-analysis-of-clothing-store

##Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of a clothing store across different online platforms using Excel. I explored key metrics like revenue by state, order status distribution, customer age and gender breakdown, and platform-wise sales.

Even though the data was available in Excel (CSV) format, I also used SQL queries to show how basic data analysis can be done in a real-world setup where data is stored in databases.

This project helped me practice data cleaning, building charts, using formulas, and creating a clean dashboard to tell a clear story from raw data.
