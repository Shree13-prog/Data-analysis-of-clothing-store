# Data-analysis-of-clothing-store

## Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of a clothing store across different online platforms using Excel. I explored key metrics like revenue by state, order status distribution, customer age and gender breakdown, and platform-wise sales. Although the data was available in Excel (CSV) format, I also used SQL queries to demonstrate how basic data analysis can be performed in a real-world setup where data is stored in databases. This project helped me practice data cleaning, building charts, using formulas, and creating a clean dashboard to tell a clear story from raw data.

## Dataset information

This dataset contains order-level details from a clothing store that sells across various platforms, including Amazon and Myntra. It includes:
- Customer Info: ID, gender, age, age group
- Order Details: Order ID, date, month, status, quantity, amount, currency
- Product Info: SKU, category, size
- Sales Channel: Online platform (e.g., Amazon, Meesho)
- Shipping Info: City, state, postal code, country
