# Data-analysis-of-clothing-store

## Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of a clothing store across different online platforms using Excel. I explored key metrics like revenue by state, order status distribution, customer age and gender breakdown, and platform-wise sales. Although the data was available in Excel (CSV) format, I also used SQL queries to demonstrate how basic data analysis can be performed in a real-world setup where data is stored in databases. This project helped me practice data cleaning, building charts, using formulas, and creating a clean dashboard to tell a clear story from raw data.

## Dataset information

This dataset contains order-level details from a clothing store that sells across various platforms, including Amazon and Myntra. It includes:
- Customer Info: ID, gender, age, age group
- Order Details: Order ID, date, month, status, quantity, amount, currency
- Product Info: SKU, category, size
- Sales Channel: Online platform (e.g., Amazon, Meesho)
- Shipping Info: City, state, postal code, country

## Key questions explored 

1. Which are the top 5 states generating the highest revenue?
2. How are the orders distributed across different order statuses (delivered, returned, cancelled)?
3. What is the order distribution across different age groups and genders?
4. Which platforms contribute the most to overall sales revenue?
5. How are orders distributed across various e-commerce platforms?
6. What is the monthly average order value trend?
7. How do sales and order volumes compare month by month?
8. What is the sales share comparison between male and female customers?
